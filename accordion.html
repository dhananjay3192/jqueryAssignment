     		   	      <p class="paragraph">Whey protein is the protein contained in whey, the watery portion of milk that separates from the curds when making cheese. Milk proteins are made up of 20% of whey proteins. Whey protein is a source of protein that might improve the nutrient content of the diet. Whey protein might also have effects on the immune system. It is favourite protein of bodybuilders and sportsmen since it is a "complete" protein.
     		   	      It is a fast digesting protein, so its bio-availability is high.

     		   	    <p class="paragraph">Casein is the main protein in milk. It made up 80% of the milk protein's content. It is the ingredient in milk that solidifies when milk curdles. When people drink milk, digestive juices break down the casein into protein pieces called casein peptides. These casein peptides are slow digesting. It is also a "complete" protein.
     		   	    Casein peptides are used for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, anxiety, fatigue, epilepsy, intestinal disorders, cancer prevention, and stress reduction.

     		   	   <p class="paragraph">Soy protein is a plant-based protein that is derived naturally from soy beans. Soy beans are members of the pea family, and are surprisingly high in proteins. The benefit, provided by soy protein, is the fact that it is naturally rich in vitamins and minerals. Soy protein provides very respectable dosages of B-complex vitamins, vitamin E, Phosphorus, potassium, zinc, and iron, all of which provide numerous benefits to the body. It is a cheap source of protein. It is a plant protein have a complete array of amino acids.
     		   	   It is a slow digesting protein.As soy protein contains phytoestrogens, it has been revealed that soy protein can lead to increases in estrogen levels, so moderate intake is
     		   	   recommended to prevent hormonal imbalances.

     		   	   <p class="paragraph">Animal protein, from meat, poultry, seafood, eggs, is considered “complete” protein. That means it contains all the essential amino acids – the ones the body can’t make on its own – the body needs.
               With the exception of quinoa and soy products, such as tofu, edamame, and soy beverages, which offer complete protein, the protein in plant foods, including beans, peas, grains, nuts, and seeds, is “incomplete” because it lacks one or more of the essential amino acids.
               But eggs and meat have the reputation of increasing cholesterol so moderate quantity holds the key or prefer the lean sources like egg whites or chicken breasts they contain less
               cholesterol.
